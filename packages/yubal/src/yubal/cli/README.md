# yubal CLI

Command-line interface for extracting metadata and downloading tracks from YouTube Music.

> **Note:** The CLI is maintained but may lack some features available in the web UI, which is the main focus of the project.

## Installation

Install the CLI so `yubal` is available on your PATH:

```sh
uv tool install './packages/yubal[cli]'
```

To update after pulling new changes:

```sh
uv tool upgrade yubal
```

To uninstall:

```sh
uv tool uninstall yubal
```

For development, you can also run it via:

```sh
uv run yubal        # from the repo root
just cli             # shorthand
```
